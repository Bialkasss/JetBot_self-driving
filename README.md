# JetBot Self-Driving Model
#### This project demonstrates the development and training of a self-driving model for a JetBot robot on a track. The model is designed to predict control commands (forward and left) based on images taken from the robot's camera, enabling autonomous navigation.

## Key Features:
- Deep Learning Model: A neural network that processes camera images and predicts control commands.
- Dataset: Images paired with control commands for training the model.
- Evaluation: The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using test data to assess its ability to make accurate control predictions.
